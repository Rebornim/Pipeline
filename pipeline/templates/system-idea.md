# System Idea: [System Name]

## Overall Purpose
<!-- What does this system do from the player's perspective? Why does it exist in the game? -->


## Player-Facing Behavior
<!-- How do players interact with this? What actions can they take? What feedback do they get? -->


## UI Requirements
<!-- What screens, HUD elements, or menus does this need? -->
<!-- What information is displayed? How do players interact? When does UI appear/disappear? -->


## Core Mechanics
<!-- Break the system into specific mechanics. Be concrete. -->
<!-- Example for gun system: Shooting, reloading, damage calc, hit detection, ammo management -->


## Instances & Scope
<!-- How many instances run at once? (one global, per player, per team, etc.) -->
<!-- Does this persist across server restarts? (DataStore needed?) -->
<!-- Is this per-player or shared? -->


## Edge Cases & Abuse Scenarios
<!-- What could go wrong? What will players try to exploit? -->
<!-- Can they spam? Duplicate? Bypass cooldowns? Crash the server? -->


## Integration with Existing Systems
<!-- Does this talk to other systems? Which ones and how? -->
<!-- Shop, spawning, inventory, economy, combat, etc. -->


## Security Concerns
<!-- What MUST be server-authoritative? What can't clients be trusted with? -->


## Performance Concerns
<!-- What could lag the game if not handled carefully? -->
<!-- Too many raycasts? Pathfinding for many AI? UI updates every frame? -->


## Open Questions
<!-- Anything you're unsure about. List it so the AI can help clarify. -->
